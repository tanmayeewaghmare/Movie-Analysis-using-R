# Movie-Analysis-using-R
This is an analysis of movies shot in San Francisco using R. I have used the popular libraries dplyr and ggplot to wrangle and visualize the data to get meaningful insights. The dataset for this project was found on this open data resource here https://data.sfgov.org/Culture-and-Recreation/Film-Locations-in-San-Francisco/yitu-d5am
